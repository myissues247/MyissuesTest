						</p>
						<p>
							To lessen the burden of City’s and federal agencies charged with the care of the truly indigent by doing everything in our power to stop these at-risk households from slipping into the cycle of poverty, despite the burden posed by an unanticipated, emergency expense; 
						</p>
						<p>
							To promote compassion and generosity on the part of individual persons living in Canada and the United States , the areas that we serve, by standing as a living testament to the power of human kindness to change lives, no matter how much (or how little) a person has to share.
